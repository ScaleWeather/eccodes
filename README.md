This crate contains (mostly) safe high-level bindings for ecCodes library.
Bindings can be considered safe mainly because all crate structures
will take ownership of the data in memory before passing the raw pointer to ecCodes.

**Currently only reading of GRIB files is supported.**

Because of the ecCodes library API characteristics theses bindings are
rather thick wrapper to make this crate safe and convenient to use.

This crate officially supports mainly Linux platforms same as the ecCodes library.
But it is possible to install ecCodes on MacOS and this crate successfully compiles and all tests pass.

**If you want to see more features released quicker do not hesitate
to contribute and check out [Github repository](https://github.com/ScaleWeather/eccodes).**

[ecCodes](https://confluence.ecmwf.int/display/ECC/ecCodes+Home) is an open-source library
for reading and writing GRIB and BUFR files developed by [European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts](https://www.ecmwf.int/).

## Usage

### ecCodes installation

This crate uses [eccodes-sys](https://crates.io/crates/eccodes-sys) with default options to link ecCodes.
Check `eccodes-sys` website for more details on how it links the library.

The recommended way to install ecCodes on your computer is using your package manager.
For example, on Ubuntu you can use `apt-get`:

```bash
sudo apt-get install libeccodes-dev
```

or `brew` on MacOS:

```bash
brew install eccodes
```

Alternatively, you can install the library manually from source in suitable directory
following [this instructions](https://confluence.ecmwf.int/display/ECC/ecCodes+installation).

Then add the `lib/pkgconfig` directory from your ecCodes installation directory
to the `PKG_CONFIG_PATH` environmental variable. If ecCodes have been compiled
as shared library you will also need to specify `LD_LIBRARY_PATH`.
For example:

```bash
export PKG_CONFIG_PATH=<your_eccodes_path>/lib/pkgconfig
export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=<your_eccodes_path>/lib
```

### Working with GRIB files

To access a GRIB file you need to create `CodesHandle` with one of provided constructors.

GRIB files consist of messages which represent data fields at specific time and level.
Messages are represented by the `KeyedMessage` structure.

`CodesHandle` implements `FallibleStreamingIterator`
which allows you to iterate over messages in the file. The iterator returns `&KeyedMessage` which valid until next iteration.
`KeyedMessage` implements several methods to access the data as needed, most of those can be called directly on `&KeyedMessage`.
You can also use `try_clone()` to clone the message and prolong its lifetime.

Data defining and contained by `KeyedMessage` is represented by `Key`s.
You can read them directly with `read_key()`, use `KeysIterator`
to iterate over them or use `CodesNearest` to get the values of four nearest gridpoints for given coordinates.

You can also modify the message with `write_key()` and write it to a new file with `write_to_file()`.

#### Example

```rust
// We are reading the mean sea level pressure for 4 gridpoints
// nearest to Reykjavik (64.13N, -21.89E) for 1st June 2021 00:00 UTC
// from ERA5 Climate Reanalysis

use eccodes::{ProductKind, CodesHandle, KeyType};
use eccodes::FallibleStreamingIterator;

// Open the GRIB file and create the CodesHandle
let file_path = Path::new("./data/iceland.grib");
let product_kind = ProductKind::GRIB;
let mut handle = CodesHandle::new_from_file(file_path, product_kind)?;

// Use iterator to find a message with shortName "msl" and typeOfLevel "surface"
// We can use while let or for_each() to iterate over the messages
while let Some(msg) = handle.next()? {
    if msg.read_key("shortName")?.value == KeyType::Str("msl".to_string())
        && msg.read_key("typeOfLevel")?.value == KeyType::Str("surface".to_string()) {
       
        // Create CodesNearest for given message
        let nearest_gridpoints = msg.codes_nearest()?
            // Find the nearest gridpoints to Reykjavik
            .find_nearest(64.13, -21.89)?;
        // Print value and distance of the nearest gridpoint
        println!("value: {}, distance: {}",
            nearest_gridpoints[3].value,
            nearest_gridpoints[3].distance);
    }
}
```

### Writing GRIB files

The crate provides a basic support for setting `KeyedMessage` keys
and writing GRIB files. The easiest (and safest) way to create a
new custom message is to copy existing one from other GRIB file,
modify the keys and write to new file.

You can find a detailed example of setting keys and writing message to file
in the documentation.

## Errors and panics

This crate aims to return error whenever possible, even if the error is caused by implementation bug.
As ecCodes is often used in scientific applications with long and extensive jobs,
this allows the user to handle the error in the way that suits them best and not risk crashes.

All error descriptions are provided in the `errors` module.
Destructors, which cannot panic, report errors through the `log` crate.

None of the functions in this crate explicitly panics.
However, users should not that dependencies might panic in some edge cases.

## Safety

This crate aims to be as safe as possible and a lot of effort has been put into testing its safety.
Moreover,Â pointers are always checked for null before being dereferenced.

That said, neither main developer nor contributors have expertise in unsafe Rust and bugs might have
slipped through. We are also not responsible for bugs in the ecCodes library.

If you find a bug or have a suggestion, feel free to discuss it on Github.

## Features

- `message_ndarray` - enables support for converting `KeyedMessage` to `ndarray::Array`.
This feature is enabled by default. It is currently tested only with simple lat-lon grids.

- `experimental_index` - enables support for creating and using index files for GRIB files.
This feature experimental and disabled by default. If you want to use it, please read
the information provided in [`codes_index`] documentation.

- `docs` - builds the crate without linking ecCodes, particularly useful when building the documentation
on [docs.rs](https://docs.rs/). For more details check documentation of [eccodes-sys](https://crates.io/crates/eccodes-sys).

To build your own crate with this crate as dependency on docs.rs without linking ecCodes add following lines to your `Cargo.toml`

```text
[package.metadata.docs.rs]
features = ["eccodes/docs"]
```
